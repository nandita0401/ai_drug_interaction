# AI Driven Drug Interaction

**Problem Statement:**

Drug interactions can cause adverse health effects, and identifying frequent drug interaction patterns is essential for patient safety. Traditional methods rely on curated databases, which can be incomplete. This project applies association rule mining (Apriori algorithm) on a single dataset (DDInter A) to detect frequent drug combinations and categorize their interactions.
